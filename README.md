# remove-android-build-dir
The Build directory is a large directory in your project its removal does not cause any problems. this directory can allways be regenerated by gradle.
This is a bash script file to remove android build directories. you can execute this script in any of your android project or in root directory of all your android projects. it will find all directories named "build" and will remove them.

Warning : do not run this script out of your android projects workspace because there is important directories named "build" out there and they should not be removed!!

this bash script only can run on linux. if you can write this script for other platform or you think you can make this better please do that and send your pull request to me.

in the end i must say i'm beginner in bash script and i hope we can make this script better together.
