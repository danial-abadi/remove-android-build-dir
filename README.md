# remove-android-build-dir
The Build directory is a large directory in your projects folder. Its removal doesn't cause any problem. This directory can always be regenerated by gradle. This is a bash script that removes these build directories. You can execute this script in any of your android project directories or in the root directory of your android projects. It finds all directories named build and remove them.

<b>WARNING:</b> Do NOT run this script out of your android projects workspace because there are some important directories named "build" out there and they WILL BE REMOVED!!

This bash script only can be run on linux. If you can write this script for any other platform or you think you can improve it, please do that and send me your pull request.

At the end, I must say I'm a beginner in bash scripting and I hope we can improve this script better, together.
